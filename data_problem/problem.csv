US9533047,in vivo formulation may require the addition of extra ingredients to facilitate circulation throughout the body
US9533047,cell density may vary from cell/50 μl to a density of 2.5×106 cells/50 μl and require from 110v to 145v to transfect cells with similar efficiencies measured in transcript copies per cell
US9533047,these complexes require the dicer ribonuclease and clr4 histone h3 methyltransferase for activity
US9533026,ephb4 antibodies mg per kg body weight were administered
US9533026,reverse signaling can occur through the ephrin bs
US9533004,strategic cleavage of such a target rna will destroy its ability to direct synthesis of an encoded protein
