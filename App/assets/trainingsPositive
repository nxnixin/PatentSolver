the accumulated grease and particulate matter within reservoir is then appropriately discarded:partialSolution
such materials are inexpensive and readily processed:partialSolution
more or fewer sensors per hose line or hose line segment may be deployed if desired:partialSolution
cable is saved in the supply channel due to the use of the flexible supply module:	partialSolution
these carts 10 are arranged in three superposed rows of four carts 10: 	partialSolution
these supply modules are usually arranged above the group of seats beneath the overhead compartment:partialSolution
the cabin lighting is seated on the light halo:partialSolution
the continuous adaptable light projection is adapted as a projection of a holographic film:partialSolution
a corresponding design of a fastening element may make it possible in a simple manner to provide a combined rotational and translational movement:partialSolution
a crc that is also to be used by passengers should have a height clearance that makes it possible for people to comfortably stand up:partialSolution
a further possible supply medium is medical oxygen:partialSolution
a lager variety of surfaces and positions can be offered to the passenger and therefore the comfort and the flexibility of handling of functional units is increased by means of the operator surface:partialSolution
a motorized mechanism not described in detail here allows movement of platform 30 :partialSolution
a passenger service unit comprising a lighting device according to claim 1 :partialSolution
a passenger service unit comprising a lighting device according to one of claims 1 to 8:partialSolution
a small overall height may result in a weight of only a few kg:partialSolution
all the seats are disposed in groups 42 of two columns of seats:partialSolution
control surfaces may also be activated in a variable manner and made available to each individual passenger:partialSolution
crcs are separate rooms that are only available for use by members of the crew:partialSolution
each gasper 66 includes a vent opening through which air is controllably emitted:partialSolution
each of the supply modules 710 is connected to a data bus 720 of the cms:partialSolution
a supply unit comprises a lighting device:partialSolution
the operator surface comprises a continuous adaptable illumination pattern:partialSolution
the suitable body is formed by a passenger's hand:partialSolution
it may also be used to receive additional seats:partialSolution
massage is thus not only relaxing but also health promoting:partialSolution
one or two rows of seats may be supplied:partialSolution
seats may also be disposed at that location:partialSolution
second compartment 24 thus is arranged above first compartment 22 but at a distance from the latter:partialSolution
steps 901 and 904 are optional:partialSolution
synonyms for certain terms are provided:partialSolution
the above-mentioned electro-optical devices may be used for modulating the light:partialSolution
the centre of the room comprises a universal gaming table 3702 :	 partialSolution
the external system comprises a cms:partialSolution
the light forming module 60 is adapted to the light source:partialSolution
the light source of the illumination unit may be a single white led which generates a very intense light with a low power consumption:partialSolution
the pisa has a small construction and a low power consumption:partialSolution
the psu pod assembly 77 can also include a panel stiffener 96 :partialSolution
the psu pods are positioned below the first height and the psu channel is positioned above the first height:partialSolution
the psu pods are positioned below the system components:partialSolution
the resulting connection is then rather of a visual nature:partialSolution
the resulting laser beam is combined with a mems mirror/scanner 4 for a dynamic light modulation and a reflection sensor 23 :partialSolution
the second zone of the first deck advantageously has a substantially planar floor:partialSolution
the space adjacent the ramps is not lost space:partialSolution
